# EcoFarm: Data-Driven Rice Simulator

EcoFarm is a web-based farming simulation game that teaches sustainable agriculture using real climate data from NASAâ€™s POWER API. The player manages a virtual rice farm over a 14-week growing season and makes decisions such as irrigation and fertilization based on weather parameters like rainfall, temperature, and soil moisture. The goal is to promote awareness of climate-smart agriculture and data-driven decision-making.
